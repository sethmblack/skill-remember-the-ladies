# Remember the Ladies

Systematically identify overlooked voices, excluded stakeholders, and absent perspectives in any decision, policy, or plan—and advocate for their inclusion. Named for Abigail Adams's historic appeal to the Continental Congress: "Remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favourable to them than your ancestors."

---

## When to Use

- A decision is being made that affects people not in the room
- You need to analyze a policy or plan for inclusion gaps
- You want to identify stakeholders who should be consulted
- Someone asks "Whose voice is missing here?"
- You're advocating for a group that lacks representation
- User says "Who is being excluded?" or "Include overlooked perspectives" or "DEI analysis"

## The Adams Advocacy Framework

### The Origin

In March 1776, as the Continental Congress debated independence, Abigail Adams wrote to her husband John:

> "I long to hear that you have declared an independancy—and by the way in the new Code of Laws which I suppose it will be necessary for you to make I desire you would Remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favourable to them than your ancestors."

> "If perticuliar care and attention is not paid to the Laidies we are determined to foment a Rebelion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we have no voice, or Representation."

The founders were creating a nation on principles of liberty and representation—while excluding half the population from both. Abigail saw the contradiction clearly.

### The Core Insight

**Those who are affected by decisions should have voice in making them.**

This principle applies far beyond gender:
- Employees affected by policies they didn't help create
- Communities impacted by developments they weren't consulted about
- Users of products designed without their input
- Future generations bearing costs of today's choices

### Why Inclusion Matters

Abigail understood both the moral and practical case:

**Moral:** "We are determined to foment a Rebelion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we have no voice." Those excluded don't consent; they comply. The difference matters.

**Practical:** Those with lived experience see what designers miss. Abigail, managing farm and family, understood practical realities her husband couldn't see from Philadelphia.

### The Tyranny Warning

> "Remember all Men would be tyrants if they could."

Power tends to serve its holders. Those with decision-making authority naturally consider their own perspectives. Inclusion is not natural—it must be intentional.

## The Remember the Ladies Process

### Step 1: Map the Affected

Before analyzing who's excluded, identify who's affected.

**Ask:**
- Who will experience the direct consequences of this decision?
- Who will be indirectly impacted?
- Who might bear long-term costs not visible now?
- Who is currently served (or underserved) by the status quo?

**Create an Affected Population Map:**
| Group | How Affected | Degree of Impact | Proximity to Decision |
|-------|--------------|------------------|----------------------|
| [Group] | [How this decision affects them] | High/Medium/Low | Near/Distant |

### Step 2: Audit Current Representation

Who is currently at the table?

**Ask:**
- Who is making this decision?
- Who is being formally consulted?
- Who has informal influence?
- Whose data or perspectives are being used?

**Representation Audit:**
| Decision Role | Who Currently Fills It | Whose Perspective They Bring |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Decision-maker | [Names/roles] | [What perspective they represent] |
| Formal advisors | [Names/roles] | [What perspective they represent] |
| Informal influencers | [Names/roles] | [What perspective they represent] |
| Data sources | [What data is used] | [Whose experience it reflects] |

### Step 3: Identify the Gaps

Compare affected populations to represented perspectives.

**Ask for each affected group:**
- Is anyone with this lived experience in the decision process?
- Is their perspective represented, even secondhand?
- Could the decision-makers accurately describe this group's concerns?
- What might this group see that current decision-makers cannot?

**Gap Analysis:**
| Affected Group | Represented? | Representation Gap | Blind Spot Risk |
|----------------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| [Group] | Yes/Partial/No | [What's missing] | [What might be missed] |

### Step 4: Assess the Stakes

Not all exclusions are equally urgent.

**Evaluate each gap:**
- **Impact magnitude:** How significantly will this group be affected?
- **Power differential:** How much less power does this group have compared to decision-makers?
- **Irreversibility:** How difficult will it be to correct course later?
- **Historical pattern:** Has this group been systematically excluded before?

**Priority Matrix:**
| Group | Impact | Power Gap | Irreversibility | Historical Exclusion | Priority |
|-------|--------|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|----------|
| [Group] | H/M/L | H/M/L | H/M/L | Yes/No | High/Medium/Low |

### Step 5: Design Inclusion

How can missing voices be included?

**Options (from most to least direct):**

1. **Full participation:** Include members in decision-making body
2. **Advisory role:** Create formal consultation process
3. **Research/data:** Gather perspectives through research
4. **Proxy representation:** Ensure advocates with lived connection are included
5. **Review process:** Have affected groups review before finalization

**For each priority gap, specify:**
- Recommended inclusion mechanism
- Specific steps to implement
- Timeline considerations
- Potential barriers and solutions

### Step 6: Craft the Advocacy

If you need to advocate for inclusion to decision-makers:

**Frame as benefit, not accusation:**
- Better decisions through more perspectives
- Reduced risk of blind spots
- Greater buy-in from affected populations
- Alignment with stated values

**Use Abigail's strategy:**
- Connect to principles decision-makers already claim to hold
- Make the practical case alongside the moral one
- Warn of consequences from exclusion
- Invite partnership rather than demanding compliance

### Decision Context
**What's being decided:** [Brief description of decision/policy/plan]
**Current timeline:** [When decision must be made]
**Current stakeholders:** [Who is currently involved]

### Affected Population Mapping

| Affected Group | How Affected | Impact Level | Currently Represented? |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------|
| [Group 1] | [Description] | High/Med/Low | Yes/Partial/No |
| [Group 2] | [Description] | High/Med/Low | Yes/Partial/No |
| [Continue...] | | | |

### Representation Gap Analysis

**Critical Gaps (High Priority):**
- **[Group]:** [Why their perspective is missing and why it matters]
  - *Blind spot risk:* [What might be missed without them]
  - *Historical pattern:* [Has this group been excluded before?]

**Moderate Gaps (Medium Priority):**
- **[Group]:** [Brief description]

### Inclusion Recommendations

**For [Critical Gap 1]:**
- *Recommended mechanism:* [Full participation/advisory/research/proxy/review]
- *Specific steps:* [How to implement]
- *Timeline:* [When this should happen]
- *Barriers and solutions:* [What might prevent this; how to address]

**For [Critical Gap 2]:**
[Same structure]

### Advocacy Strategy

If you need to advocate for this inclusion to decision-makers:

**Frame:** [How to position inclusion as beneficial to them]
**Principles to invoke:** [Values they claim that support inclusion]
**Practical case:** [Concrete benefits of including these voices]
**Warning:** [Consequences of proceeding without inclusion]
**Ask:** [Specific request]

### The Adams Test
> "Would we hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we have no voice, or Representation?"

Apply this test to each affected group. If they would reasonably object to being excluded, inclusion is warranted.
```

---

## Constraints

- This is analysis and advocacy, not accusation. Assume good faith in current decision-makers.
- Inclusion has costs (time, complexity). Acknowledge these honestly while making the case.
- Not every group can be included in every decision. Prioritize based on impact and stakes.
- Representation is not tokenism. Including one person does not guarantee perspective is heard.
- Advocacy should invite partnership, not create enemies.

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Our company is redesigning our parental leave policy. The committee includes HR leadership, legal, finance, and two senior executives. We need to finalize next month."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Remember the Ladies Analysis

### Decision Context
**What's being decided:** Company parental leave policy redesign
**Current timeline:** One month to finalization
**Current stakeholders:** HR leadership, legal, finance, two senior executives

### Affected Population Mapping

| Affected Group | How Affected | Impact Level | Currently Represented? |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Parents (current employees) | Direct beneficiaries of policy | High | No |
| Prospective parents | Will use policy in future | High | No |
| Non-parents | May perceive equity issues; cover for absent colleagues | Medium | Partial (may overlap with committee) |
| Managers | Must implement and manage coverage | Medium | Partial (senior execs may not manage directly) |
| Recruiters | Policy affects talent attraction | Medium | No |
| Remote workers | May have different needs/contexts | Medium | Unknown |
| Single parents | Different support needs | High | No |
| Non-birthing parents | Often receive less leave; different needs | High | No |
| LGBTQ+ parents | Adoptive/surrogacy paths may differ | High | No |
| Employees with elder care | May perceive policy inequity | Low-Medium | No |

### Representation Gap Analysis

**Critical Gaps (High Priority):**

- **Current parents who have used existing policy:**
  - *Why it matters:* They know what worked and what didn't. They experienced the policy's practical reality.
  - *Blind spot risk:* Committee may not understand real-world implementation challenges, return-to-work struggles, or manager responses.
  - *Historical pattern:* Policy decisions often made by those not directly affected.

- **Non-birthing parents (fathers, same-sex partners, adoptive parents):**
  - *Why it matters:* They often receive less leave; their needs differ. Policy may unintentionally signal whose parenting matters.
  - *Blind spot risk:* Designing primarily for birthing mothers misses significant portion of parents.
  - *Historical pattern:* Parental leave historically framed around maternity only.

- **Single parents:**
  - *Why it matters:* No partner to share leave; different support needs; often more vulnerable.
  - *Blind spot risk:* Policies assuming two-parent households may not serve single parents well.

**Moderate Gaps (Medium Priority):**

- **Front-line managers:** Will implement policy; know what's feasible for team coverage.
- **Recruiters:** Know how current policy affects talent attraction.
- **Remote/distributed workers:** May have different support needs.

### Inclusion Recommendations

**For current parents who used existing policy:**
- *Recommended mechanism:* Advisory focus group (can be done quickly)
- *Specific steps:*
  1. Invite 6-8 employees who used parental leave in past 3 years
  2. Conduct 2-hour session: What worked? What didn't? What do you wish existed?
  3. Share findings with committee before finalization
- *Timeline:* Can complete in first two weeks
- *Barriers and solutions:* Privacy concerns—ensure confidentiality; time constraints—offer compensation or schedule flexibly

**For non-birthing parents:**
- *Recommended mechanism:* Include at least one in parent advisory group; research best practices
- *Specific steps:*
  1. Ensure focus group includes fathers who took leave, non-birthing parents in same-sex couples
  2. Research peer company policies for non-birthing parent leave
- *Timeline:* Integrate into parent focus group
- *Barriers and solutions:* Fewer non-birthing parents may have used leave (result of current policy)—adjust expectations

**For single parents:**
- *Recommended mechanism:* Direct outreach for input; policy review through their lens
- *Specific steps:*
  1. Identify and invite single parents who've used leave to share perspective
  2. Explicitly review draft policy: "Does this work for someone without a partner?"
- *Timeline:* Can parallel parent focus group
- *Barriers and solutions:* Smaller population—may need to seek input individually

### Advocacy Strategy

If you need to advocate for this inclusion to the committee:

**Frame:** "We're designing a policy people will live with. Including their voices makes it better and increases buy-in."

**Principles to invoke:**
- Company values around employee voice and inclusion
- Commitment to competitive benefits that attract talent
- Data-driven decision making (employee input is data)

**Practical case:**
- Policies designed without parent input often fail in implementation
- Non-birthing parent leave is increasingly expected by candidates
- Blind spots create legal/equity risks

**Warning:** "If particular care and attention is not paid to those affected, they will not feel bound by policies in which they had no voice. We'll face complaints, turnover, and disengagement."

**Ask:** "Can we add a two-hour focus group with diverse parents before finalizing? I'll help organize it."

### The Adams Test

> "Would we hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we have no voice, or Representation?"

Parents using this policy will live with its provisions during one of life's most significant transitions. They have the right to inform its design. The committee members, however well-intentioned, may not have recent parenting experience. Including affected voices is both right and practical.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Abigail Adams** expert persona. Use it whenever decisions are being made that affect people not in the room—which is nearly every decision of consequence. Abigail saw the contradiction in liberty for some; this skill helps you see and address the contradictions in any decision that excludes those it affects.
